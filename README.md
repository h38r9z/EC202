1. Consider   lottery   A   which   oﬀers   you   the   chance   to   win   £1,000,000   with   probability   0.0001
and   get   zero   otherwise,   and   lottery   B   which   oﬀers   you   the   chance   to   win   £1,000,000   with
probability   0.001   and   get   zero   otherwise.   An   axiom   of   the   expected   utility   hypothesis   implies   that   the   person   prefers   lottery   B   to   lottery   A.   Which   axiom   is   this? (4 marks) 
A.      Completeness B.    Transitivity
C.      Monotonicity   D.      Independence   E.      Continuity
2. Consider   a   lottery   X   which   consists   of   prizes   denoted   in   £   sterling.    Let   a   person’s   expected utility   for   lottery   X   be   equal   to   U   (X).   Assume   C   is   the   certain   amount   (in   sterling)   which      satisﬁes   the   following   equality:   u(C) =   U   (X).    That   is,   the   utility   of   C   is   equal   to   the
expected   utility   of the   lottery.    Assuming   the   person   is   risk   averse,   which   statement   must   hold? (4 marks) 
A.    C   > E(X)
B.    C   = E(X)
C.    U   (X)   =   C
D.    C   −   E(X)   < 0
E.      E(X) − C   < 0
